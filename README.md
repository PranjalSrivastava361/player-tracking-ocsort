# Player Tracking in Sports Videos Using OC-SORT  
### Assignment Submission – Multi-Object Tracking 

This project implements the **architecture, abstract classes, and pipeline design** for a real-time multi-object player tracking system based on **OC-SORT**, as required in the assignment.

Sports videos have high visual traffic — players frequently:
- cross each other  
- look very similar  
- move non-linearly  
- get partially or fully occluded  

To maintain **consistent player IDs across frames**, a robust multi-object tracker is required.
